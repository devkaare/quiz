# CLI Quiz Tool

## Introduction

This is a CLI tool designed to quiz you (the user) with questions from `questions.json` (useful for practicing for tests etc) NOTE: You can add, remove and replace the questions inside this file,
BUT the json structure needs to stay the same for the code to work.

## Requirements

A [Go compiler](https://go.dev/dl/) is **required** to run this program.

## Getting Started

- OPTIONAL: Replace the questions inside `questions.json` with custom ones before starting
- Start the quiz by running `go run main.go` (in the same directory as the `main.go` file)
